## 2026-01-12 - Todo cleanup (PRD #1, #2, #3)

Removed todo example code from entire codebase:
- Deleted backend router (apps/backend/src/routers/todo/)
- Deleted frontend components, queries, mutations
- Deleted DB schema, types, relations
- Updated index route to redirect to /dashboard

Note: db:push not run - table still exists in DB but code is clean. Run manually if needed.

Next: PRD #4-7 (pockets cleanup, multi-step demo removal)
